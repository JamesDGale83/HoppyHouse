        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p> 
          We are a non-profit organization dedicated to the wellbeing of all beautiful pets, 
          but we choose to focus on rabbits. We are a foster-based domestic rabbit rescue that 
          helps rehabilitate rabbits that were abandoned, neglected, and abused domestic rabbits.

        <h2>HHRR Compassion and Ethics Statement:</h2>
        <p>
            HHRR does not discriminate based on race, political stance, sexual orientation, gender identity, dietary lifestyle, or religious affiliation. We welcome all walks of life providing they follow our rules and protocols that are focused solely on the care and well-being of domestic rabbits.
        </p>
        <p>
            HHRR will not use our non-for-profit status to advocate for any political, social platform, or cause. Our only focus is and always will be for the well-being of domestic rabbits.
        </p>
        <p>   
            HHRR reserves the right at any time to remove comments and posts from our social media pages if those posts contradict our education or go directly against our protocols. 
        </p>
        <p>    
            HHRR has no paid employees. We are 100% volunteer-based and 100% of all monies raised via fundraisers and donations go directly to the medical needs and basic rabbit supplies for our rescue rabbits.
