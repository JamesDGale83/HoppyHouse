      Many of you saw our recent post — and things have gotten serious fast. In just the last few days, with our rescue partners weve rescued over 350 animals🐕🐔🐓🐐🐇
 we've taken in over 250animals. That's right… more than 250 lives now depending on us. 🐰🐔🐐
 <br>
All of them are currently in quarantine, being monitored and cared for, but we are running low on supplies. We desperately need:
<br>

🐇 Rabbit food<br>
🐔 Chicken feed<br>
🐐 Goat food
<br>
We can't do this alone — we need help right now to keep everyone fed and safe while we work to get them healthy and ready for new homes.
If you can donate food, supplies, or even share this post to spread the word, please do. Every bit helps more than you know.
💔 Thank you to everyone who continues to step up for these animals. They're counting on us — and we're counting on you.
